## Requirements

Packages needed 

`pandas`

`folium`

`tika` : Java version 7 is needed

### In development 

Developers can install and run the program using `git clone`

`git clone git@github.com:aparnac25/extract.git`

In repo there is a working jupyter notebook of code that can be run. To open notebook use: 

`jupyter notebook --no-browser`

and type in local host address into browser of choice.
