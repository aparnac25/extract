# `extract`

This program will accomplish three things: (1) read a PDF and extract sample location names and GPS coordinates; (2) convert to decimal deggrees format, and (3) plot converted coordinates to a map.

## Requirements

Java version 7 is needed for python package `tika`. To install use: 

`pip install tika`

### In development 

Developers can install and test the program using `git clone`

`git clone git@github.com:aparnac25/extract.git`

In repo there is a working jupyter notebook of code that can be run. To open notebook use: 

`jupyter notebook --no -browser`

and type in local host address into browser of choice


## Not working 

Currently the `pip install` is not working. Hopefully soon one can use below code to run on command line.

`cd ./extract`

`pip install -e .`
